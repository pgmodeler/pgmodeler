### Relationship implementation rules ###

[One to One relationship (1:1)]

(0,1) ---<>--- (0,1)
	 >> Columns are added on the destination table in order to represent the relationship.
	 >> The columns that represents the foreign key must accept null values.
	 >> The policy for DELETE and UPDATE events on the foreign key must be SET NULL.
	 >> The relationship attributes and constraints are added on same table where the
			foreign key columns are added.

(1,1) ---<>--- (0,1)
(0,1) ---<>--- (1,1)
	 >> Columns ared added on the table which minimum cardinality is 0.
	 >> The columns that represents the foreign key must accept null values.
	 >> The policy for DELETE and UPDATE events on the foreign key must be SET NULL.
	 >> The relationship attributes and constraints are added on same table where the
			foreign key columns are added.

(1,1) ---<>--- (1,1)
	 >> Not implemented because breaks the user modeling since its necessary to
			merge the envolved tables. If the user persists in creation of this type
			of relationship an error is raised.

------

[One to Many relationship (1:n)]

(0,1) ---<>--- (0,n)
(0,1) ---<>--- (1,n)
(1,1) ---<>--- (0,n)
(1,1) ---<>--- (1,n)

	>> Columns are added on the destination table in any cardinality combination.
	>> When the minimum cardinality is 0 on the "One" side (e.g. (0,1)) the foreign key columns
		 must accept null values in order to represent the optionality of the relationship. Also
		 the foreign key ON DELETE and ON UPDATE policy must be SET NULL.
	>> When the minimum cardinality is 1 on the "One" size (e.g. (1,1)) the foreign key columns
		 mustn't accept null values (NOT NULL) to represent the entity mandatory participation. Also
		 the foreign key ON DELETE and ON UPDATE policy must be RESTRICT.
	>> For identifier relationships the ON DELETE and ON UPDATE for the foreign key must be CASCADE
		 because the weak entity only exists if the strong exists too.

------

[Many to Many relationship (n:n)]

(n) ---<>--- (n)

	>> One table is created to represent the relationship. In the relationship type there is no
		 cardinality this means that the relationship is alway represented as (n) ---<>--- (n).
	>> Two foreign key is created on the new table each pointing to one of the envolved tables.
	>> The ON DELETE policy for the foreign keys must be RESTRICT.
	>> The ON UPDATE policy for the foreign keys must be UPDATE.
	>> The created table primary key is the union of the two foreign key columns.

------

[Relationships of degree > 2]

Must be manually simulated using the available binary relationships.

------

[NOTE]

* Case one relationship attribute is the identifier (primary key) for the "Many to Many" table
	relationship the fisrt will be merge with the automaticaly created primary key.

* "Many to Many" cannot be created as identifier because the two entities (tables)
	are always strong (in pgModeler's implementation).

* Case the relationship is identifier, this means, there is a weak entity
	in one side of the relatioship must be used the following rule:

	 1) The weak entity primary key must be composed with the columns used
			to reference the strong entity (foreign key columns)

	 2) The ON DELETE and ON UPDATE policy for the foreign key must be CASCADE, because
			for instance, in the case of one tuple on the strong entity is deleted the
			weak entity tuples must be destroyed also because this latter exists only because
			the first. */
