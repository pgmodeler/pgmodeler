\ingroup libgui
\brief Implements the macros that replaces the Qt's signal/slot connect method for cases
when a slot throws exceptions that need to be treated in the limits of the slot execution
preventing the exception to be redirected to the outside world which may lead to
unexpected behavior and crashes.

//! \brief This macro expands to a block of code inside a try/catch blockz
#define __trycatch(body) \
try \
{ \
	body \
} \
catch(Exception &e) \
{ \
	Messagebox::error(e, __PRETTY_FUNCTION__, __FILE__, __LINE__); \

/*! \brief This macro expands to a slot method call to be used with QObject::connect method.
 * The macro takes as arguments the receiver object, and the method to be executed that is
 * owned by the receiver object (slot). Only slots that TAKE NO ARGUMENTS are accepted.
 *
 * The expanded macro encloses the slot call in a try/catch block inside a
 * lambda function in order to self-contain all exceptions that eventually go
 * outside the slot scope, avoiding undefined behavior and crashes.
 *
 * NOTES:
 *
 * 1) Differently from the original Qt's signal/slot connection, the slot passed
 * to the macro MUST NOT be the reference (address) of the receiver's method.
 *
 * 2) The macro uses the receiver object as the lambda captured object/variable, so
 * it's not possible to specify other lambda capture modes. If this is needed then
 * you have to create a commom connect call using a lambda as slot and specify
 * the needed captures.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * > Qt's original
 *		connect(sender, &SenderClass::s_someSignal, receiver, &ReceiverClass::someMethod)
 *
 * > Macro (note the absence of & in slot specification)
 *		connect(sender, &SenderClass::s_someSignal, context, __slot(receiver, ReceiverClass::someMethod))
 *
 * > The expanded result of the macro usage will be:
 *		connect(sender, &SenderClass::s_someSignal, context, [receiver](){
 *			try {
 *				receiver->ReceiverClass::someMethod();
 *			}
 *			catch(Exception &e) {
 *				Messagebox::error(e, __PRETTY_FUNCTION__, __FILE__, __LINE__);
 *			}
 *		});
