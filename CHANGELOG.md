* [Change] Minor adjustment on widgets that are used to set connections.
* [Fix] Fixed the way objects are destroyed when a model is closed diminishing the time consumed by that operation and the chances of crashes after their destruction.
* [Fix] Additional fix in database import feature. Inheritances will be automatically created when "auto resolve dependencies" is checked.
* [Fix] Fixed a crash when importing a database that contains big tables that handles multiple inheritances.
