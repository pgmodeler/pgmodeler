		> Icon: it is a PNG image that represents the plugin on the plugins toolbar.
    > Plugins can have a optional lang subdir in which are stored the translation for them. The translation files must be named
      as [plugin name].[lang code].qm, for instance, Brazilian Portuguese translation for "dummy" would be: "dummy.pt_BR.qm".

    Note: Plugins can have another additional subdirectories but any reference to them must be made programatically by the plugin author. */
