v0.9.2-beta1
------

<em>Release date: September 2, 2019</em><br/>
<em>Changes since: <strong>v0.9.2-beta</strong></em><br/>

<strong>Summary:</strong> this release brings a few improvements as we're starting to deaccelarate the development of new features and concentrating on minor changes and bug fixes until the stable 0.9.2 is done. <br/>

The main focus was to improve the data manipulation form, fix some small UI problems and bugs on some features detected previously. <br/> 

The file saving was patched in such way to write a backup file prior to the saving of a model to avoid data loss in rare circumstances (mainly on macOS systems). <br/>

The diff process was also fixed due to a bug that was returning some false-positive results when dealing with timestamptz columns. <br/>

This version also brings the ability to select multiple table children (columns, contraints, triggers, etc) and operate over them by using the design popup menu. <br/>

Finally, some changes of this version are detailed below. For the complete list of changes/fixes, please, read the CHANGELOG.md. <br/>
